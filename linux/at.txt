# at Command Cheat Sheet for Linux

## Basic Usage
1. Schedule a command to run at a specific time:
   at <time>
   Example:
   at 14:30

2. Run a command at a specific time:
   echo "command" | at <time>
   Example:
   echo "ls -l > output.txt" | at 15:00

3. Run a script at a specific time:
   at <time> -f /path/to/script.sh
   Example:
   at 16:00 -f /home/user/myscript.sh

## Time Formats
- Absolute Time:
  - HH:MM (e.g., 14:30 for 2:30 PM)
  - midnight, noon, teatime (4 PM)
  - MMDDYY, MM/DD/YY, DD.MM.YY (e.g., 102523 for October 25, 2023)

- Relative Time:
  - now + X minutes/hours/days/weeks (e.g., now + 2 hours)
  - tomorrow (same time tomorrow)

## Common Options
- List scheduled jobs:
  atq
  or
  at -l

- Remove a scheduled job:
  atrm <job_id>
  Example:
  atrm 5

- View the contents of a scheduled job:
  at -c <job_id>

- Run a job in a specific queue:
  at -q <queue> <time>
  (Queues are letters a-z, with higher letters having lower priority.)

## Examples
1. Schedule a job to run at 10 PM:
   at 22:00

2. Schedule a job to run in 2 hours:
   at now + 2 hours

3. Schedule a job to run tomorrow at 8 AM:
   at 8:00 tomorrow

4. Schedule a job to run on October 31, 2023, at 9 PM:
   at 9:00 PM 103123

5. List all scheduled jobs:
   atq

6. Delete a job with ID 3:
   atrm 3

## Notes
- The `at` command relies on the `atd` service. Ensure it is running:
  sudo systemctl status atd

- Jobs are executed in the user's environment, so environment variables and paths are preserved.
