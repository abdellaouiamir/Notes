Possible Outcomes Based on Your Git Settings
1. If pull.rebase = false (Default Behavior)

    Git will do a merge between main and your feature branch.
    A new merge commit will be created if there are new changes in main.
    If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them manually.

2. If pull.rebase = true

    Git will rebase your feature branch on top of the latest main.
    Your local commits will be rewritten to apply them after main's latest commits.
    If there are conflicts, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them.


# .gitignore
# .git/info/exclude # to add custom file to ignore for u locally and they don t need to be in the .gitignore file
# u can have multiple .gitignore in u project and each one apply on it s directory and subdirecotry if it doesn t have .gitignore file
# example
*.txt # exclude any .txt file
/file.py # exclue only that path 
dirctory # exlcue and directory that have the same name
file.file # exlude any file that have the same name
!example.txt # ignore every thing unless it example.txt

# Working Tree
# work tree is bascilly u working directory that contane the tracked and untracked files
# ls .git/worktrees

# the linked worktree containt a .git with path to the main working tree
# complicted to work with env file and secrets and node modules

git worktree add <path> <branch>

# if u just provide the path it will use the last path directory as default branch name for the new working tree
# u can t open the same branch in two work tree in the same time
git branch
# the + before the branch_name it tell u that this branch open in another working tree
# the * for the current working tree
